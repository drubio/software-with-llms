## ðŸ“˜ Volumes

### [Start Building with LLMs â€“ Fundamentals, APIs, and UIs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WXXM59) _(Volume 1)_

Covers how LLMs work, their evolution, and how to access them via APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI). Includes building a complete app using:

- Step-by-step examples for developers new to LLMs
- LangChain and LlamaIndex for basic chats with LLMs
- Assistant UI components and vanilla React


### Scale LLM Systems â€“ Agents, Routing, and Infrastructure _(Volume 2)_ _(coming soon)_

Explores:

- Multi-agent orchestration using frameworks like CrewAI
- Managing model infrastructure with LiteLLM and OpenRouter
- Designing scalable, fault-tolerant systems with context and robustness in mind

### Advanced LLM Applications â€“ RAG, Personalization, and MCP _(Volume 3)_ _(coming soon)_

Focuses on:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
- Real-time user interaction with LLMs
- Applying the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for dynamic, extensible applications
