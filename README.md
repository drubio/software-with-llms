- Managing model infrastructure with LiteLLM and OpenRouter
- Designing scalable, fault-tolerant systems with context and robustness in mind

### Volume 3 â€“ Real-Time Interfaces & Context-Aware Systems _(coming soon)_

Focuses on:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
- Real-time user interaction with LLMs
- Applying the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for dynamic, extensible applications
